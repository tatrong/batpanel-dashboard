# BatPanel Dashboard

**BatPanel** is a Batman-inspired admin dashboard built entirely with **HTML and CSS** â€” no frameworks, no JavaScript.  
The goal was to create a visually striking, responsive, and fully functional dark interface that feels like operating the Batcomputer itself.

## Design Language

All color and style elements are managed with CSS variables for theme consistency:

```css
:root {
  --bg-main: #121212;
  --bg-soft: #1a1a1a;
  --bg-card: #1e1e1e;
  --accent: #ffcc00;
  --text-primary: #f5f5f5;
  --text-secondary: #ccc;
  --text-muted: #888;
}
```
